We use:
  CONTAINER:    webm
  VIDEO:	VP9  (until AV1 is supported widely inside of a webm)
  AUDIO:	opus

CONSIDER:
  CONTAINER:	ISO Base media File Format
  VIDEO		AV1
  AUDIO:	opus

=============================================================================

Container:
    mp4
    	-- Commercial
    ogv
    	-- xiph.org, perhaps not widely supported container?
    mkv (matroska)
    	-- General container, webm is more specific for our case.
        -- Standardization for containing AV1 is not finalized, published Sep18 but
               	then breaking changes followed.
    webm
    	-- Royalty free licence from Google
        -- Internal container is matroska, just a special usage of matroska

    ISO Base Media File Format
    	-- Based off Apple QuickTime, developed by MPEG; MPEG4 was based on this
        	too.
    	-- Used by YouTube
	-- AOMedia specification
        -- ONLY CONTAINER formally standardized for AV1 video.

Audio Formats:

    MP3
    AAC
    	-- Commercial, patented, widely used
    HE-AAC
    	-- Commercial, patented, widely used
    Vorbis, succeeded by Opus
    	-- Free, but replaced by opus now.
    Opus (2012)
    	-- Newest free one
        -- Replaces both Vorbis and Speex

    Listening tests:

Video Formats:

  <2012:
    H.264/MPEG-4 AVC (succeeded by HEVC)
    	-- Commercial, patented, widely used
    	-- Removed from Chromium/Chrome HTML5 tag
    Theora
	-- html5 spec original, but requirement was removed
	-- commercial users fear unknown patent holders
  ~2012:
    HEVC (2012)
        -- Commercial, patented
        -- 50% bitrate savines over H.264
        -- x265 open-source encoder (in par with vp9, but slightly better)
    VP9 (2012) succeeded by AV1
    	-- royalty-free licence from Google
        -- libvpx open-source encoder (on par with HEVC via x265, but slightly worse)

  ~2017:
    AV1 (2017)
    	-- royalty-free licence from AOMedia
        -- Not yet supported in Android, or Edge on mobile. Available elsewhere.
        -- AV1 in Matroska (and thus webm) was not finalized yet as of late 2018...
        	where is it at now?
	-- 30% savings compared to VP9
